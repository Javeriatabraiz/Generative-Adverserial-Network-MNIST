# Generative-Adverserial-Network-MNIST
Basic GAN on MNIST

This repository implements a simple Generative Adversarial Network using the MNIST dataset. The project demonstrates how a GAN can learn to generate handwritten digit images by training two neural networks in opposition. One network, the generator, creates images that resemble the digits, while the other network, the discriminator, learns to distinguish between real MNIST images and those generated by the generator. The focus of this project is on understanding the fundamental mechanics of GANs, including how the two networks interact and improve over time. The MNIST dataset, containing thousands of handwritten digit samples, serves as an ideal training ground for this basic experiment. Enjoy exploring and experimenting with the basic GAN architecture using MNIST data.
